# CostSensitiveLearning
Cost-sensitive learning to address class imbalance and misclassification cost in a multiclass setting using lasso regularized logistic regression and gradient boosted decision trees.

### K2_Csboost: a cost sensitive algorithm in a binary framework.
K2_Csboost is a classification algorithm that accounts for misclassification costs and class imbalance by taking a cost matrix of size 2x2. 

### K_Csboost: a cost-sensitive algorithm in a multinomial framework.
K_Csboost is a classification algorithm that takes into account misclassification costs and class imbalance by taking a cost matrix of size K*K. It is a generalization of the binary framework.
